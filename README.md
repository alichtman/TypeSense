## TypeSense
---

TypeSense is a Chrome extension that displays the sentiment impact of each message in a Facebook Messenger conversation in real-time. Winner of the best Healthcare-related OSS hack at HackIllinois 2018.

##### Why?
---

Conversations can be complicated. With an increasing reliance on digital communication, the body language and intonation cues we use to interpret meaning in someoneâ€™s words quickly disappear. People without psychological disorders misunderstand each other all the time. Sarcasm makes it hard to know for sure what someone means, and idioms are confusing! _Imagine how hard it is for people with social difficulties._

[TypeSense serves to simplify social interaction? help people respond appropriately to incoming messages? idk someone help ]

Designed to help users with pervasive developmental disorders, like Aspergers or Autism.
